# Phishing_Detection_Using_Python
## Web Browser Code
The proposed project tries to detect
and prevent the URL phishing attack. The project will be preventive as it takes any url as
input, classifies the url to any one of the category i.e., phishing, suspicious and legitimate thus
preventing the user from unknowingly getting directed to the fake websites, and losing
personal credentials to the attacker.
* The python file "shield" contains the code.
* The csv file "train1" contains the dataset.
* The Images folder contains all the required images.
### Note
* The code runs only in Python 3 version.
* The links to download the tools is provided in the "Tools" document.

## Mail Information Extractor
The "Mail Info Extracter" folder contains the code to extract the the essential information from an unread email.
### Note: 
This particular folder contains three codes.It should be made sure that all the three codes should be contained in a single folder along with the csv file "train1". Also a folder named "Data" should be created within the existing folder. On running the "Main.py" the files are created within Data folder with all the extracted mail information. Among these "Status" contains the status of the URLs present in the mail.
