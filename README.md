# Phishing_Detection_Using_Python
##Web Browser Code
The proposed project tries to detect
and prevent the URL phishing attack. The project will be preventive as it takes any url as
input, classifies the url to any one of the category i.e., phishing, suspicious and legitimate thus
preventing the user from unknowingly getting directed to the fake websites, and losing
personal credentials to the attacker.
